# SkyPong
- This is a simple pong game that i will use to learn c++, it is pretty basic
# controls
**most the things use buttons in this build so**
- Escape:  Pause/Resume
- I: change theme (deprecated)
- B/G: volume up/down (deprecated)
# build
- to build skypong instead of using the available binaries, you need to have the whole raylib library, ball.h, a.h, aa.h aaa.h, tstk.h, discord_rpc.h and discord_register.h, also you need the corresponding libs
- put all the include files in an include folder, and all the libraries in the lib folder and run make
- you're good to go!
